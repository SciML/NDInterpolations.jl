DataInterpolationsND.jl is a library for interpolating arbitrarily high dimensional array data. The domain of this interpolation is a (hyper)rectangle. Support is included for efficient evaluation at multiple points in the domain through [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl).

For one dimensional interpolation see also [DataInterpolations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DataInterpolations.jl).

DataInterpolationsND.jl is similar in functionality to [Interpolations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl), a well established interpolation package that is currently much more feature rich than DataInterpolationsND.jl. We hope to justify the existence of DataInterpolationsND.jl through its use of the KernelAbstractions and its planned integration with the SciML ecosystem.

## API

An `NDInterpolation` is defined by a tuple of interpolation dimensions and the data `u` to interpolate.

```julia
using DataInterpolationsND

t1 = cumsum(rand(5))
t2 = cumsum(rand(7))

interpolation_dimensions = (
    LinearInterpolationDimension(t1),
    LinearInterpolationDimension(t2)
)

# The outputs will be vectors of length 2
u = rand(5, 7, 2)

interp = NDInterpolation(u, interpolation_dimensions)
```

Evaluation of this vector valued interpolation can be done in place or out of place.

```julia
interp(0.5, 0.5)

out = zeros(2)
interp(out, 0.5, 0.5)
```

If we provide `t_eval` for the interpolation dimensions, we can evaluate at these points either 'zipped' (where all `t_eval` must be of the same length) or as a grid defined by the Cartesian product of the `t_eval`.

```julia
interpolation_dimensions = (
    LinearInterpolationDimension(t1; t_eval = range(first(t1), last(t1); length = 100)),
    LinearInterpolationDimension(t2; t_eval = range(first(t2), last(t2); length = 100))
)

interp = NDInterpolation(u, interpolation_dimensions)

# Out of place zipped evaluation
eval_unstructured(interp) # Yields Matrix of size (100, 2)

# In place grid evaluation
out = zeros(100, 100, 2)
eval_grid!(out, interp)
```

This is particularly efficient for evaluating the interpolation for the same `t_eval` multiple times with different values for `u`, because the indices (and basis functions if applicable) for the `t_eval` are cached during the interpolation dimension construction.

## Available interpolations

The interpolation types are given by the corresponding interpolation dimension type.

  - `LinearInterpolationDimension(t)`: Linear interpolation in the sense of bilinear, trilinear interpolation etc.
  - `ConstantInterpolationDimension(t)`: An interpolation with a constant value in each interval between `t` points. The Boolean option `left` (default `true`) can be used to indicate which side of the interval in which the input lies determines the output value.
  - `BSplineInterpolationDimension(t, degree)`: Interpolation using BSpline basis functions. The input values `t` are interpreted as knots, and optionally knot multiplicities can be supplied. Per dimension a degree can be specified. Note that for an `NDInterpolation` of this type, the size of `u` for a certain dimension is equal to `sum(multiplicities) - degree - 1`. This interpolation dimension type can also be used to define NURBS, by passing `cache = NURBSWeights(weights)` to the `NDInterpolation` constructor.
